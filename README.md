🧠 Stress Level Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting human stress levels using machine learning techniques based on physiological and lifestyle-related features.
Stress is a major health issue in modern life. By using data-driven models, this system helps identify stress levels in individuals, which can be useful for early intervention and self-awareness.
📌 Features
- Predicts stress levels (Low / Medium / High or numerical scale)
- Uses supervised machine learning algorithms
- Provides data preprocessing and feature selection
- Model evaluation with performance metrics
- Easy to extend and integrate with real-world data
🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Flask (optional, if you used UI)
